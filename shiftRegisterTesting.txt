Case 1:
Parallel load is always asserted, 8 bits are loaded into place. After these 8 bits are loaded, parallel data in goes to zero, and we observe a full shift in the output.

Case 2:
Parallel load is never asserted, we observe a reading of serial data into the LSB

Case 3:
Peripheral clock edge is non-periodic, so we observe non-periodic shifting. Parallel load is always asserted.

Case 4:
Parallel load is toggled.

Sam: Cases 1 and 2
Emma: Cases 3 and 4
