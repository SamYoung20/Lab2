The goal of loading onto the FPGA was to test the shift register using serial inputs.

Test zero: We reset parallelIn by pushing button 0. This initial value was 01010101.

From here, we conducted a series of tests.

Test one: 0,0,0... until we clear the register
Test two: All ones until we fill the register
Test three: Alternating pattern of zeros and ones to set register to a random value

In order to give the FPGA these inputs, we change the value of switch zero to be high
or low. We change switch one to go high, and we observe the addition of the value on
switch zero to the end of the shift register. We are able to observe the four LSB
of the register by pressing button 2, and the four MSB by pressing button 3.

To load all zeros, we keep switch zero low. We flip switch 1 up and down 8 times
to load them all onto the register and clear the previous value. The opposite
holds true for loading all ones.

We press button zero to reset the entirety of the register to its initial
value. 

We took videos of these tests, shown here:
